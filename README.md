# Magento 2 Shop by Brand
Brands act as a trust-building factor amongst online shoppers. They give assurance of product quality to the end customers and facilitate them to make the purchase without thinking twice.

In case you are running an online Magento store and selling products from multiple brands, you may require a functionality on your store that facilitates the customers to shop for products from their favorite brands. However, there is no such functionality in the default version of Magento.

Meetanshi’s ***[Magento 2 Shop by Brand ](https://meetanshi.com/magento-2-shop-by-brand.html)*** extension by Meetanshi facilitates the easy creation of reports in Magento 2. Helps generate customized reports, run and save custom SQL queries in a more detailed way!

Data reporting plays a crucial role in any eCommerce business. Generating detailed reports helps businesses to know more about their customers, their purchase history and make well-informed decisions.
